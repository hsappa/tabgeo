## Code style divergences
* no intentional divergences

* I originally coded this up with many more DIV tags and replaced just about all with 
  meaningful tags.  But there are some layout DIVs that resisted being 
  treated as other elements. I understand that DIVs are elements of last resort but 
  would appreciate feedback on whether their use was appropriate.
